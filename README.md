# Module 9 Challenge

This project was designed for us to allow a user to create README file. The user
enters their input for the given categories and then the README file is generated
using those inputs. 

I was able to accomplish this by:
   -Using inquirer to create input prompts
   -Creating functions for the generateMarkdown file to display input
   -Testing in node.js

This one was a little bit simpler because we had to go off of with the starter code 
and we just needed to make sure the prompt was asking the questions we needed answers to.
